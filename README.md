# SafeLA-Enhancing-Traffic-Safety-through-Data-Driven-Analysis

This project analyzes motor vehicle collision data through two main components: a Jupyter Notebook (EDA and Cleaning.ipynb) and a Power BI dashboard (Collision Insights.pbix). The notebook performs exploratory data analysis and data cleaning, handling missing values, standardizing formats, and engineering relevant features such as time-based variables. The cleaned dataset is then used in the Power BI report, which presents interactive visual insights into collision trends, locations, and severity. Together, these tools provide a comprehensive pipeline from raw data to actionable insights, supporting data-driven decision-making for road safety and traffic management.
